# IndexedDB Promise Wrappers

This is a practice library I'm writing to practice a bunch of new techniques and patterns. This should NOT be used by anyone for anything meant to be useful.

Developing tools and skills:
1. IndexedDB API
2. Mocha tests
3. Chai BDD assertions (should)
4. Improving Promise & async/await understanding
